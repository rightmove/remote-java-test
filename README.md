## Before Your Interview
Before your interview, please ensure that you can run the project on your machine and that the project is already open before your interview begins.

You can validate this by running the gradle task `./gradlew build` in your command line. This task will among other things, compile the code and run the tests. You should get a successful build. 


> Note - Please don't modify any code in the project just yet. The interviewer will be pairing with you on the day of the interview. Use of AI tools during the interview is strictly prohibited.

### Requirements
**Java** - This project has been configured to use Java 11. However, we have confirmed that this project will work with a minimum Java 1.8. 
If you need to do this, then you can by modifying line 23 of the root `build.gradle` file, changing the `sourceCompatibility`. 
```
sourceCompatibility = 11

```
You can also choose to use a newer version by setting
```
sourceCompatibility = 17
```
```
sourceCompatibility = 19
```
